# to do tasks (until monday)
# 1. improve the functionality of adding loops (ask on Tuesday if this is a natural error of Alpha alg.)



# 4. css for source node (with black inner circle)
    # css the whole website once again
    # test with other test files too. (DONE)
        # reorder place nodes
    # try upload to the gitlab
# 5. optimize the code

# 2. ask if my diagram has to exactly assemble the ones (DONE)
    # order the place nodes alphabetically from left to right
        # i came across the solution idea that, i should sequentially traverse the diagram node after node
        # and adapt the name of each place i come by.
        # --> difficult because we have no way to traverse a graphviz diagram


# 6. study heuristic miner and try implementing it
# 7. learn postman tutorial

# 8. more questions for further development:
    # should i let the page work in sessions ? (the program doesn't have to recreate a new object for each
    # page loading
